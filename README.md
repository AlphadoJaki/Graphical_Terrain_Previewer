# Graphical Terrain Previewer

Graphical Terrain Previewer converts the elevation value with gray scale gradation.
This improves the terrain visibility of Random Gen World Previewer, in exchange for biome visibility.

## Available Modes
There are 3 modes available

### WorldPreview
Map actual in-game world. Show elevation as gray scale gradation.
-28 is BLACK, 190 is WHITE.
